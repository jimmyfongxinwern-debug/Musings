So how interested are you for this project to learn how to code, basically if you rate the importance from 1-10 and then compare it how to make money? <answer here first>

Ok in that case, i want to introduce into a non novel but immoral land of stealing from others, leveraging other peopleâ€™s IP to make money. The goal being make nothing except for money.

So we enter the world of sales, but not in the traditional sense of how to deceive people into thinking they are making a good deal, but in the sense of repackaging things so that others understand the use, so we have basically formulating contribution not as doing good to others, but doing good for others in a way that they understand which i think is a key distinction especially if you want to contribute well, and also incidentally collect capital, money. 

So now about sales, what we are doing is basically a cognitive rebranding, or more holistically cognitive reframing, we will now see it as a gradation of how much we need to repackage something that already exists (effort) and finding the appropriate customers, especially via free channels, social media (non ads, organic promotion, etc2), anyhow methodology aside. So think about maybe having github projects, open source, or simply APIs, and then we tailor it to a use case for gov, business, personal, and package in such a way it feels like its made for them, specifically so, and we have ai so thats great.

Anyway an even more underlying philosophy thats way less exploitative to this whole thing is actually, which i purposely left at the end to test your tolerance for the whole debauchery is, there are so many good products in the world that are dying off simply because they cant get to the right customers, who are we to make even more, effectively taking the image of the kids in the orphanages and pets at the shelters, isnt it irresponsible to reproduce, wasting capital resources that could otherwise be used for a better cause. Sales is ironically still an underdeveloped industry from this perspective.
